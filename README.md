## 👋 Hello!

Welcome to @moodyhunter's GitHub profile page, he/him, ~~BTW I Use Arch~~

### Quick Personal Description

- 💻 ArchLinux!
- ❤️ Used C / C++ / C# (.Net) / Haskell / ~~HTML~~ / Java / LaTeX / QML (Currently Learning)
- 🍏 Enjoyed Qt Desktop Application Development
- 🏫 CS Student @ University of Warwick
- 🗞️ GPLv3!

### I'm currently...

- Learning QML, especially the QML plugin with CMake, 
  - Learning by reading [Qaterial](https://github.com/OlivierLDff/Qaterial)
- Learning CMake by making [Qv2rayBase](https://github.com/moodyhunter/Qv2rayBase), a CMake-based library project.
- Learning Qt by maintaining a personal fork of Qv2ray:
  - Since `Qv2ray/Qv2ray` is not maintained anymore (seems to be), it'll be a great time to fork and maintain by myself.

### I will, probably do...

- Learning cryptography
